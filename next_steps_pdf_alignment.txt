Next steps: Fix misshaped / misaligned PDF overlay

1) Re-upload and compare
- Upload the same GeoPDF twice: once using auto georef, once using manual SW/NE.
- If auto looks rotated/skewed vs the basemap but manual looks better, the PDF likely has rotation/shear (Leaflet image overlays are axis-aligned).

2) Prefer a warped / north-up raster
- If you have a backend-produced warped WGS84 north-up PNG (e.g., PUR076_testwarp.png), use that for the overlay.
- Warping removes rotation/shear so an axis-aligned overlay can line up correctly.

3) Verify Poppler is installed (pdf2image dependency)
- pdf2image requires Poppler’s `pdftoppm` at runtime.
- Check: `pdftoppm -v`
- If missing on macOS: `brew install poppler`

4) Confirm bounds are WGS84 (EPSG:4326)
- The browser expects lat/lon bounds.
- If the PDF is in a projected CRS (Albers/UTM/etc.), ensure any extracted bounds are transformed to WGS84 before use.

5) Watch for axis-order flips
- Some GDAL/PROJ configurations can swap axis order (lat/lon vs lon/lat).
- Symptom: mirrored map or wildly offset placement.
- Sanity check for your area: lon ~ -121, lat ~ 54.

6) Check for rotation/shear in the PDF georeferencing
- If the geotransform has non-zero rotation/shear terms (often `gt[2]` and `gt[4]`), an axis-aligned overlay will distort unless you warp first.

7) Rule out resolution/DPI issues
- Very low DPI rasterization can look “off” when zooming.
- If the overlay is soft or the perceived offset changes with zoom, try generating a higher DPI / larger PNG and re-check.

8) Align using known points
- Pick 2–3 obvious control points (road intersections, stream junctions).
- If error grows across the page (good in one corner, bad elsewhere) → rotation/shear → warping needed.
- If the error is a constant shift everywhere → bounds/origin offset → manual SW/NE or nudging fixes it.

9) Avenza comparison test
- Export a simple test polygon (small square around a landmark) and load into Avenza.
- If it’s consistently shifted by the same amount/direction → adjust placement/bounds.
- If it’s distorted (fits in one area but not another) → rotation/shear issue → use warped PNG workflow.
